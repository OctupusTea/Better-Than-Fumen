# Better-Than-Fumen

A Python-based Fumen editor aims to enahnce usability and simplify Fumen sharing

## Current Status

- Fully working canvas with lineclear highlight, placement, placement ghost, and field shifting
- Scroll or click to change drawing mino
- Shift-scroll to change placement rotation
- Click and drag to draw
- Shift-click and shift-drag to draw placement
- Shift-arrowkeys (up/down/left/right) to shift the whole field around

> The current control methods for placement (shift-click), placement rotation (shift-scroll) and field-shifting (shift-arrowkeys) are an add-on to the common practice
> 
> I'll add more control methods similar to those in [Fumen for Mobile](https://knewjade.github.io/fumen-for-mobile/) or [Fumen Editor](fumen.zui.jp/)
