# Better-Than-Fumen

A Python-based Fumen editor aims to enahnce usability and simplify Fumen sharing

## Current Status

- Fully working canvas with lineclear highlight, placement and ghost preview
- Scroll or click to change drawing mino
- Shift-scroll to change placement rotation
- Click and drag to draw
- Shift-click and shift-drag to draw placement

> The shift-click and shift-scroll part is again an add-on to the common practice (just like scrolling to change mino)

> I'll add at least one placement drawing method similar to either [Fumen for Mobile](https://knewjade.github.io/fumen-for-mobile/) or [Fumen editor](fumen.zui.jp/)
